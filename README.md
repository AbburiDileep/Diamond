# Diamond price prediction analysis

This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization.

Content
price price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x length in mm (0--10.74)

y width in mm (0--58.9)

z depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

How Diamonds are formed?

Diamonds are formed deep within the Earth about 100 miles or so below the surface in the upper mantle.
Obviously in that part of the Earth it’s very hot.
There’s a lot of pressure, the weight of the overlying rock bearing down, so that combination of high temperature and high pressure is what’s necessary to grow diamond crystals in the Earth.

Why are Diamonds so Valuable?
Whether it is a Rare book, a fine bottle of Scotch, or a Diamond, something that is Rare and Unique is often expensive.
But what makes it truly Valuable is that this Rarity coincides with the desire of many to possess it. ;)
Diamonds are Rare because of the Incredibly powerful forces needed to create them.
And therefore Diamonds are considered to be Very Costly.
 
From the analysis Decision tree  Regressor gives us the highest R2-Score [ 98% ].
